# Amazon-React-Tailwind

This is my first project using React. Previously, I built an Amazon clone using only HTML and CSS, but this version is fully responsive and optimized for small devices with smooth animations.

## Features
- Built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**
- Fully **responsive design** for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Smooth animations** for better user experience
- Functional **sliding sidebar** with overlay effect
- **Reusable components** for better scalability
- **Optimized for performance**

## Tech Stack
- **React** (Component-based UI development)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Utility-first styling)
- **Vite** (Fast development and build tool)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/akm2006/Amazon-React-tailwind.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd Amazon-React-tailwind
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Build for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:
```sh
npm run build
```

## Future Improvements
- Implement backend API for dynamic product data
- Improve animations and UI interactions
